			captured in services. Hence, what services exist in SOA is the most
			interesting question for a analyst, software architect or developer.
			Service repositories are the most important tool to answer questions
			like:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>What services are available?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What is the contract of a service?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In what state is the service? Can I use it for production?
				</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What dependencies does it have?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>...</p></li></ul></div><p>Usually a service repository will import WSDLs, XSDs and other
			documents to describe the available services. However, WSDL is a
			rather technical webservice related description of a service. It does
			not define the complete formal service contract independent of the
			technology being used. E.g. the version of a service and it&rsquo;s
			dependencies are not defined or considered meaningful to a certain
			technology stack.</p><p>Another issue is, that often SOA Governance will define
			additional rules that apply to service contract. The Governance board
			has to review every service contract, whether it meets the compliance rules, it has
			defined. This is going to reduce the agility in service development.
		</p><p>Xtext Service Repository resolves these issues in two
			ways:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Use DSLs to describe formal service contracts with all required
					details</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use model validators to verify formal constraints without the
					need to involve the SOA governance board</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use code generation to apply technical rules implicitly, e.g.
					all webservices use document/literal-wrapped SOAP style and schema
					centralization</p></li></ol></div></div></body></html>
