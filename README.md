=====================================

Xtext Service Repository is an OpenSource SOA service repository that is based on Xtext for service modelling. It does more than just storing and managing contracts of services in a SOA environment: Based on contracts defined with DSLs as well as applying model validators and code generation, it speeds up the service development and SOA governance approval processes with automated compliance checks.
