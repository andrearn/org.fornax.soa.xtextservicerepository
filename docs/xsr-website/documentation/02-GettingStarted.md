# {{page.title}} {#GettingStarted}

To get started, you should first have a look at XKonneX Repository Example projects. There you will find a simple and a more advanced example. Both examples consist of an XKonneX Repository project containing the domain model and generator project, that shows how to generate code from the model.

## Examples
### Simple example

The simple example has minimal domain model leaving out all advanced concepts around services and architecture governance.

### REST service example

The REST service example demonstrates the modeling of a REST service API

### Advanced example

The advanced example provides an example for more detailed modeling regarding governance properties, system environment definitions and overrides for conventions applied when nothing else is specified.
